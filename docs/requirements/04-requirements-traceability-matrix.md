# RQ-04 — Requirements Traceability Matrix

> **Status: ✅ Authored (bootstrap as-built, 2026-07-06; delta 2026-07-09 for the procgen-world
> increment — 17 new rows, target requirements; delta 2026-07-10 — FR-6400 added (BL-0020),
> Feature Spec/Implementation Package columns filled for the 17 target rows now that
> `06`/`07` have run, NFR-6100/NFR-1200/NFR-7100/NFR-5200 Test cells refreshed; delta 2026-07-11
> — NFR-6500/6510 Test cells filled with real evidence, `BL-0045`; delta 2026-07-11 —
> FR-9140/9150/2330 and CR-05 added for `ADR-0012`'s maze-adjacency decision, `BL-0064`–`BL-0067`).**
> Owned by `04-requirements-engineering`.
> One row per [RQ-01](01-functional-requirements.md)/[RQ-02](02-non-functional-requirements.md)
> requirement (Candidates marked). Populates the row-level matrix
> [GDS-10](../architecture/10-requirements-traceability-matrix.md) §3 deferred to this stage, using
> its origin → requirement → feature → implementation → verification row shape and its

> Package, Test) are `UNASSIGNED` where stages 05–09 haven't run yet** — this is the honest,
> expected state on the bootstrap increment, not a defect. The Test column is filled where
> `test_rom.py`'s T1 suite (the only suite GDS-02 established as trustworthy, per BL-0006) already
> provides real, current evidence; every other Test cell is marked per RQ-03 finding #3.

## Notes on this matrix's honesty discipline

- **No cell in the Feature Spec / Implementation Package columns is anything but `UNASSIGNED`** —
  stages 05 (`05-feature-decomposition`) and 07 (`07-implementation-planning`) have not run.
  Filling these in now with a guessed future FS-xxx/IP-xxxx name would violate this skill's
  explicit prohibition on inventing forward references.
- **The Test column distinguishes three real states**, not two: (1) a genuinely trustworthy
  existing test (only `test_rom.py` T1, cited directly by ID), (2) a test that exists but is
  non-compliant per BL-0006 (named explicitly so a future reader doesn't mistake "a check with
  this name exists" for "this requirement is verified"), and (3) no automated check exists at all
  (plain `UNASSIGNED`).
- Every `BL-xxxx` reference in this matrix (BL-0003, BL-0006, BL-0008, BL-0009, BL-0017, BL-0018)
  is cited as GDS-10 §4 anticipated — a backlog ID functioning as a citable cross-cutting anchor,
  not a prose aside.
- **2026-07-09 delta:** the 16 new rows (FR-1170–FR-9200, NFR-1300–NFR-6510) all carry
  `UNASSIGNED` Feature Spec/Implementation Package/Test cells with an explicit "not yet
  implemented" annotation — these are target requirements for the adopted increment
  ([PLAN-requirements-aesthetics-story-map.md](../pipeline/PLAN-requirements-aesthetics-story-map.md)),
  none of which has reached stage 05 yet. Module cells are marked `(proposed)` where GDS-09's
  delta names a new module (`worldgen.py`) or an extension to an existing one, distinguishing
  "this is where it will live" from the existing rows' "this is where it does live."
