## Notes on this matrix's honesty discipline

- **No cell in the Feature Spec / Implementation Package columns is anything but `UNASSIGNED`** —
  stages 05 (`05-feature-decomposition`) and 07 (`07-implementation-planning`) have not run.
  Filling these in now with a guessed future FS-xxx/IP-xxxx name would violate this skill's
  explicit prohibition on inventing forward references.
- **The Test column distinguishes three real states**, not two: (1) a genuinely trustworthy
  existing test (only `test_rom.py` T1, cited directly by ID), (2) a test that exists but is
  non-compliant per BL-0006 (named explicitly so a future reader doesn't mistake "a check with
  this name exists" for "this requirement is verified"), and (3) no automated check exists at all
  (plain `UNASSIGNED`).
- Every `BL-xxxx` reference in this matrix (BL-0003, BL-0006, BL-0008, BL-0009, BL-0017, BL-0018)
  is cited as GDS-10 §4 anticipated — a backlog ID functioning as a citable cross-cutting anchor,
  not a prose aside.
- **2026-07-09 delta:** the 16 new rows (FR-1170–FR-9200, NFR-1300–NFR-6510) all carry
  `UNASSIGNED` Feature Spec/Implementation Package/Test cells with an explicit "not yet
  implemented" annotation — these are target requirements for the adopted increment
  ([PLAN-requirements-aesthetics-story-map.md](../pipeline/PLAN-requirements-aesthetics-story-map.md)),
  none of which has reached stage 05 yet. Module cells are marked `(proposed)` where GDS-09's
  delta names a new module (`worldgen.py`) or an extension to an existing one, distinguishing
  "this is where it will live" from the existing rows' "this is where it does live."
