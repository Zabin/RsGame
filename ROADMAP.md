# Documentation Roadmap

Single authoritative tracker for **every document this project produces or has planned** — what
exists, what depends on what, and what's still open. Humans and future sessions read this file
first to answer "what's done, what's in flight, what's left" without re-deriving it from `git
log` or scanning the tree.

**Update this file whenever a document's status changes.** Finish a doc → flip it to ✅. Start
one → 🚧. Identify a new doc → add a row with `⛔ Planned`. Don't let this file drift from
reality. The owning skill flips its rows together with the theme `INDEX.md` in the same commit.

## Status legend

| Symbol | Meaning |
|---|---|
| ✅ | Done — written, current, matches the implementation/research it describes. |
| 🚧 | In progress — drafted but incomplete, or gate not fully closed. |
| ⛔ | Planned — identified as needed, not yet started. |
| ♻️ | Living — intentionally never "done"; updated continuously. |

`Depends on` lists the IDs whose content a document assumes or must stay consistent with — not a
build order.
